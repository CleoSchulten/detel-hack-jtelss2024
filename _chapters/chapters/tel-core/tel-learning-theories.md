#h2 Why Learning Theories in TEL 

**“Its not about the medium, Its about the learning (theories)”**  Paul A. Krischner. 

TEL as a academic field for their high emphasis on technology, while ignoring the learning theories. As he correctly put it, Technology changes (rapidly), implications of learning (theories) prevail. While many technologies have had prominent impact on educational paractice in institutions across the world, arguably, technologies that support existing traditional practices, such as google documents for collaboration, powerpoints for presentations etc, have had a lasting impact to date. Educational practices are informed from research and evidence in learning sciences but the role of educational technology should be to support this evidence-based practice rather than forcing teachers to radically change their teaching methods to adapt to the affordances of technology (Technology acceptance model). 



#h2 Explanation of paradigms 


To explore paradigm and theories clearly, we asked ChatGPT to illustrate difference between paradigms and theories in the Learning Sciences. 

## Lists

Paradigm:
A paradigm in the learning sciences is a broad framework or set of beliefs and assumptions that guide research and practice in the field. It encompasses the overarching worldviews, methodologies, and approaches to understanding learning and education. Paradigms shape how researchers conceptualize problems, design studies, and interpret data. In the context of learning sciences, common paradigms include: Behaviorism, Cognitivism, and Constructivism. 
Theory:
A theory in the learning sciences is a specific set of principles or propositions that explain how learning occurs. Theories are more focused and detailed than paradigms, providing specific explanations and predictions about learning processes. Theories are often developed within the context of a larger paradigm but provide concrete mechanisms and models for understanding specific aspects of learning. Examples include Classical Conditioning (Pavlov), Piaget’s Stages of Cognitive Development, Vygotsky’s Social Constructivism, but not limited.

Differences
Scope:

Paradigm: Broad and overarching, providing a general framework for research and practice.
Theory: Specific and focused, offering detailed explanations and predictions about particular aspects of learning.
Function:

Paradigm: Guides the general approach to studying and understanding learning, influencing the choice of methodologies and research questions.
Theory: Provides concrete explanations and models for how learning occurs, often leading to testable hypotheses.



Behaviorism
Theories
Behaviorism is a paradigm in the learning sciences that focuses on observable behaviors and how they can be shaped or modified through various forms of conditioning. Here is an explanation of the behaviorism paradigm, including its principles, key figures, theories, and applications in learning:

Principles of Behaviorism
Observable Behavior: Behaviorism emphasizes the study of behaviors that can be observed and measured, rather than internal mental states.
Stimulus-Response: Learning is viewed as a change in behavior resulting from the association between stimuli and responses.
Conditioning: There are two main types of conditioning in behaviorism—classical conditioning and operant conditioning.
Reinforcement and Punishment: Behaviors are influenced by their consequences. Reinforcements (positive or negative) increase the likelihood of a behavior, while punishments decrease it.

Some learning models
Gamification involves incorporating game-like elements and principles into non-game contexts, such as education, to enhance engagement, motivation, and overall learning experiences. For example, it involves reinforcing the learner's behavior by rewarding and punishing.

TEL examples
Kahoot! is an interactive quiz platform that uses game-like elements such as points, badges, and leaderboards to motivate and reinforce learning through competition and rewards (Wang, et al).

Cognitivism
Cognitivism considers that learning can be compared to the way a computer processes information. The learner gathers information and constructs an internal symbolic database of real world objects and experiences. Information may come from a perceived expert (the teacher). Learning focuses on structured schemas ((Seel, 2012)).
Here are the some exemplary theories based on cognitivism: 
Cognitive Load Theory: This theory suggests that learning is affected by the amount of information processing required. Overloading cognitive capacity can hinder learning, so instructional design should aim to reduce unnecessary cognitive load (Sweller et al., 2011) (Sweller, 2011).

Dual Coding Theory: According to this theory, people process verbal and non-verbal information separately and simultaneously, which can enhance learning when both types of information are presented together (Paivio, 1986) (Paivio, 1986).

Schema Theory: This theory emphasizes the role of prior knowledge in learning, suggesting that new information is better understood when it can be integrated into existing cognitive structures, or schemas (Bartlett, 1932) (Bartlett, 1932).

	
Some learning models
Bloom's Taxonomy: A hierarchical model used to classify educational learning objectives into levels of complexity and specificity, ranging from simple recall of facts to higher-order thinking skills such as analysis, synthesis, and evaluation (Bloom, 1956).

TEL examples
MindMeister is a digital mind mapping tool that helps students organize and integrate information, supporting cognitive processes like understanding, organizing, and retrieving knowledge (Meirbekov et al.).

Constructivism
Constructivism is a paradigm in the learning sciences that posits that learners actively construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world through experiences and reflecting on those experiences. It contrasts with traditional models of learning that view knowledge as something that can be transmitted from teacher to student.

Principles of Constructivism
Active Learning: Learners are active participants in their own learning process, not passive recipients of information.
Constructing Knowledge: Knowledge is constructed based on personal experiences and hypotheses of the environment. Learners build new knowledge upon the foundation of previous learning.
Social Interaction: Learning is a social activity. Interaction with others plays a critical role in the process of constructing knowledge.
Contextual Learning: Learning is context-dependent. Understanding is developed in relation to the context in which knowledge is applied.
Reflection: Reflection on experiences is essential for the construction of new understanding.
Theories
Jean Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development:

Piaget proposed that children move through four stages of cognitive development: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational.
Learning is seen as a process of adaptation to the environment, involving assimilation and accommodation (Piaget, 1971).

Lev Vygotsky’s Social Development Theory:

Vygotsky emphasized the fundamental role of social interaction in the development of cognition.
The concept of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) suggests that learners can achieve higher levels of understanding with the guidance of a more knowledgeable other (Vygotsky, 1978).

Jerome Bruner’s Constructivist Theory:

Bruner introduced the idea of scaffolding, where support is gradually removed as learners gain independence.
He emphasized the importance of discovery learning, where learners construct new ideas based on their current knowledge (Bruner, 1960).

Some learning models
Project-Based Learning (PBL) is one of the learning models in Constructivism. PBL is an instructional methodology that enables students to learn by engaging in real-world and meaningful projects. This approach emphasizes active exploration and inquiry, encouraging students to collaborate, think critically, and develop solutions to complex problems (Krajcik, et al).

TEL examples
Scratch is a coding platform where students can create their own interactive stories, games, and animations, engaging in problem-solving and creative thinking.  By “learning materials” one normally means a textbook, but a routine textbook would not be compatible with the constructionist educational philosophy upon which Scratch is based (Meerbaum-Salant, et al).

Conclusion

History of learning paradigms
Pavlov with in his seminal study <name>, established and postulated that all forms of learning can be explained in terms of stimuli and response. Several theories
