**Abstract:** This chapter aims at introducing the field of technology enhanced learning (TEL) with a bird's eye view on the whole field by looking into some of the overall approaches that we have without covering all of the different aspects that we have in this field in detail. We want to highlight some of the challenges that we are facing in TEL Further, we want to focus on the typical “entry situation” that new PhD students find, when they approach their PhD research in the TEL field, given that TEL is an interdisciplinary field, where ideas, approaches and methods from various fields come together and potentially collide.
