**Abstract:** This chapter aims at introducing the field of technology enhanced learning (TEL) with a bird's eye view on the whole field by looking into some of the overall approaches that we have without covering all of the different aspects that we have in this field in detail. We want to highlight some of the challenges that we are facing in TEL Further, we want to focus on the typical “entry situation” that new PhD candidates find when they approach their PhD research in TEL, given that TEL is an interdisciplinary field, where ideas, approaches and methods from various fields come together and potentially collide.

# **What is TEL - definitions**

The term Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) was coined in the context of working groups initiated by the European Commission in 2000. It is now broadly used to designate “a field of research aiming at improving learning by integrating current technologies and designing innovative ones” {% cite Bourdeau2014 %}.
According to Kirkwood and Price, the term has been used since around 2005 to describe a research focus concentrating on the impact of technology on learning {% cite Kirkwood-and-Price %}.
While TEL is a standing term in European research, sometimes its related expressions are preferred internationally, such as Educational Technology, Digital Education, and Learning Engineering.

## **Interdisciplinarity of TEL**

All terms and definitions recognize the need of epistemic fluency to facilitate interdisciplinary dynamics, in which participating professionals have “the capacity to understand, switch between, and combine different kinds of knowledge and different ways of knowing” {% cite Markauskaite-and-Goodyear %}. 
TEL is an interdisciplinary field that connects Computer Science with the Learning Sciences, Psychology, and other Social Sciences, Humanities, or Engineering Sciences {% cite Meyer-et-al-2013 %}, {% cite Tchounikine2011 %}, {% cite Kalz-and-Specht %}.

According to Conole et al., Kalz & Specht and Scanlon & Taylor 2016, the research focus of TEL has led to interdisciplinary perspectives integrating theories and methods {% cite Conole2010 %}, {% cite Kalz-and-Specht %}. Pammer-Schindler et al. describes TEL research as an intersection of Learning Sciences, Educational Psychology, and Computer Science, investigating interventions based on digital technologies in education and training settings {% cite Pammer-Schindler-feduc-2020 %}.

## **TEL as a field of study and research**

The term TEL has not only been used to describe a research domain, it has also been the foundation for a number of higher education study programs {% cite Orey2017 %}. This landscape has been characterized as continuously changing {% cite Dennen2007 Spector2015 %}, {% cite Dennen2007, Spector2015 %}. A systematic analysis of master study programs in TEL found that their curricula rely on subjects of educational sciences and management of TEL in an organization, while the share of technological subjects is relatively small {% cite Fominykh2022 %}.
