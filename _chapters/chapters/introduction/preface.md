The Open book on Doctoral Education in Technology Enhanced Learning (DETEL book) is an open educational resource for doctoral candidates working in the field of Technology-Enhanced Learning or TEL (also known as Educational Technology, Digitl Education, Learning Engineering) and related fields.

The community behind this book aims to develop expertise in doctoral candidates, provide knowledge from multiple relevant perspectives and allows taking empirically-based decisions in implementing TEL solutions in practice. The goal of the book is to bring doctoral education in TEL to a new level with a high-quality resource to support better curricular integration and avoid fragmentation of the digitalisation of education.

The book will be available as Open Educational Resource (OER) under the Creative-Commons-License CC-BY-SA.
