# 3 Tools and technology   

A myriad of technological options can be used to support digital game-based learning. One is the mobile device, considering its high penetration rate and can be combined with other technologies, such as Augmented Reality (AR) or Virtual Reality (VR), (Marques & Pombo, 2021, p1)
